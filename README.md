# 🧠 Yugaank Rathore — Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio — a single-page site designed to **represent me, my work, and my mindset** as a Computer Science student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.  
Every pixel and line of code exists for one purpose: clarity through precision.
